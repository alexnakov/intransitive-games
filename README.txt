Please read this before continuing this project further:

I am focusing on content, I don't use the stylesheet.
Any needed CSS is done inline, if I have to duplicate element trees so be it.

The Rock Paper scissors example is done in terms of basic content/knowledge.
NOTE: This shall be done after Penney's Game
 - It needs running code for mini-animation
 - Needs explanation of code

Next-to-do:
 - Research Penney's game and play with code on collab
 - Write content about Penney's game.
 - ^ Do this on another HTML file so you don't always have to look at the top.
