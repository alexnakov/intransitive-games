<h3>How to play the game</h3>
<ul>
<li> There are four different die which can be chosen in this game, as shown below with their corresponding letter.</li> 
<li> This is a two player game which involves the players choosing two differnt die to roll the highest score against each other.</li> 
<li> These dice, as shown, are not regular dice; although they are standard cubes, and so the probability that each face is rolled is equal to $\frac{1}{6}$, they have different numbers on their faces when compared to the conventional dice.</li> 
<li> The first player chooses one of the dice and the second chooses one of the remaining dice, rolling them and comparing scores,
the winner has the higher score (same as the number on the 'top' of the dice).</li> 
</ul>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
  <img src="options.svg" width="400px">
</div>


<p>The dice have the following values for each face on the dice:</p>
<ul>
<li>C = [3,3,3,3,3,3]</li> 
<li>D = [4,4,4,4,0,0]</li> 
<li>E = [5,5,5,1,1,1]</li> 
<li>F = [6,6,2,2,2,2]</li> 
</ul>

<p>This game is an example of a <strong>non-transitive</strong> game. In this set of dice each dice rolls higher than another more than half the time, i.e. normally wins, and so satisfies
the definiton. <cite>[1]</cite>.</p>

<h3>Python Code</h3>
<p>Below is a python code which provides the statistics of wins for each combination of die (forgive the delay for the graph):</p>
<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python3/7d1c1f99ac" width="100%" height="356" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>The following paragraph will explain parts of the code and how it works.</p>

<p>The 'total' variable is assigned a value of <em>1000000</em>, this is so that the probabilities generated are as close to the true value as possible. In lines <em>9-12</em> there are lists for the variables, <em>'c'</em>, <em>'d'</em>, <em>'e'</em> and <em>'f'</em>. They contain each face of their respective dice. 
As the probability of any face appearing is $\frac{1}{6}$, choosing one of the values randomly has the same probability as rolling that number. From lines <em>27-43</em>, the letter each player inputs assigns the choice to a specific variable. As there are <em>4</em> different possible inputs
for each player, <em>8</em> possible variables are needed.

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
<code>
if a_choice == 'c':                     
    a_choice = c
if a_choice == 'd':
    a_choice = d 
if a_choice == 'e':
    a_choice = e
if a_choice == 'f':
    a_choice = f
    
if b_choice == 'c':
    b_choice = c
if b_choice == 'd':
    b_choice = d 
if b_choice == 'e':
    b_choice = e
if b_choice == 'f':
    b_choice = f  
</code>
</pre>
 Line <em>46</em> uses a <em>while</em> loop to repeat the rolls until the 'total' limit is hit. Lines <em>49</em> and <em>50</em> assigns one of the 'face' values of their corresponding dice, using the <em>random.choice()</em> function, from the lists of the corresponding dice.
Lines <em>52-56</em> gives a 'point' to the dice that wins, as no two values of two different dice are the same, one dice will always win. This process is repeated till the limit is reached.

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
<code>
i = 0
while i < total:
    i = i + 1
    
    a_roll = random.choice(a_choice)                    
    b_roll = random.choice(b_choice)
    
    if a_roll > b_roll:
        a_score = a_score + 1                       
        
    if b_roll > a_roll:
        b_score = b_score + 1
</code>
</pre>

Lines <em>75-166</em> repeats the actions of lines <em>46-56</em>, however instead of using the players inputs, there are <em>6</em> similar loops, where the six different combinations are used
, where <em>'a'</em> and 'b' are assigned a random item from the lists of the specific die. Finally, lines <em>170-175</em> showcase a table of values. The odds of winning for each dice in each pair are inserted into the <em>print</em> function, where a table is formatted. Just like previously,
 the <em>.format()</em> function applies a <em>1d.p.</em> for each value.</p>


<p>The graph at the end of the code gives, approximately, the odds of winning for each dice when played against the various other dice. These approximations
are based on fractions which can be worked out to give the true probability of each win for each combination of two die. They are presented below:</p>

<h3>The maths behind the statistics</h3>
<p>The data collected can be explained using the probability of getting each various value for each dice, as each 'face' has an equally likely chance of $\frac{1}{6}$
of rolling, and can be illustrated using tree diagrams, with dice E and D being used as an example:</p>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
  <img src="tree.svg" width="400px">
</div>

<p>If player A chooses dice E, and player B dice D, then as player A rolls first, if a <em>5</em> is rolled, a win is certain as all the faces on dice D are lower than <em>5</em>. If a <em>1</em> is rolled however, a win or loss is dependent on player B. If dice D rolls a <em>0</em>, which has a $\frac{2}{6}$ chance of rolling, player A wins again, however if a <em>4</em> is rolled, which has a $\frac{4}{6}$ chance of rolling, then player B wins.
 So adding the two scenarios in which player A wins give the total probability that dice E wins, which is $\frac{2}{3}$, and the scenario that D wins is $\frac{1}{3}$.

<p>Essentially all that is happening here is that you combine all the probabilities of situations where your dice wins to give the total probability or odds that your dice has
a greater score. Tree diagrams can be used to calculate the probability of winning when choosing the second die for the various other die.</p>
<p>By using the probability for each individual roll for each pair of die we get the following:
<br>
<ul>
<li>C winning against D:  &nbsp Odds of D rolling a zero &nbsp $*$ &nbsp Odds of C rolling a three &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{2}{6} * 1$ &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{2}{6}$ &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{1}{3}$;<br> D winning against C: &nbsp Odds of D rolling a four &nbsp $*$ &nbsp Odds of C rolling a three &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{4}{6} * 1$ &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{4}{6}$ &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{2}{3}$ </li> <br><br>
<li>C winning against E:  &nbsp Odds of E rolling a one &nbsp $*$ &nbsp Odds of C rolling a three &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{3}{6} * 1$ &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{3}{6}$ &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{1}{2}$;<br> E winning against C: &nbsp Odds of E rolling a five &nbsp $*$ &nbsp Odds of C rolling a three &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{3}{6} * 1$ &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{3}{6}$ &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{1}{2}$ </li> <br><br>
<li>C winning against F:  &nbsp Odds of F rolling a two &nbsp $*$ &nbsp Odds of C rolling a three &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{4}{6} * 1$ &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{4}{6}$ &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{2}{3}$;<br> F winning against C: &nbsp Odds of F rolling a six &nbsp $*$ &nbsp Odds of C rolling a three &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{2}{6} * 1$ &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{2}{6}$ &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{1}{3}$ </li> <br><br>
<li>D winning against E:  &nbsp Odds of D rolling a four &nbsp $*$ &nbsp Odds of E rolling a one &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{4}{6} * \frac{3}{6}$ &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{12}{36}$ &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{1}{3}$;<br> E winning against D: &nbsp Odds of E rolling a five &nbsp $*$ &nbsp $1$ &nbsp $+$ &nbsp Odds of E rolling a one &nbsp $*$ &nbsp Odds of D rolling a zero &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{3}{6} * 1$ &nbsp $+$ &nbsp $\frac{3}{6} * \frac{2}{6}$ &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{3}{6}$ &nbsp $+$ &nbsp $\frac{1}{6}$ &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{2}{3}$</li><br><br>
<li>D winning against F:  &nbsp Odds of D rolling a four &nbsp $*$ &nbsp Odds of F rolling a zero &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{4}{6} * \frac{4}{6}$ &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{16}{36}$ &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{4}{9}$;<br> F winning against D: &nbsp Odds of F rolling a six &nbsp $*$ &nbsp $1$ &nbsp $+$ &nbsp Odds of F rolling a two &nbsp $*$ &nbsp Odds of D rolling a zero &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{2}{6} * 1$ &nbsp $+$ &nbsp $\frac{4}{6} * \frac{2}{6}$ &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{2}{6}$ &nbsp $+$ &nbsp $\frac{8}{36}$ &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{5}{9}$</li> <br><br>
<li>E winning against F:  &nbsp Odds of E rolling a five &nbsp $*$ &nbsp Odds of F rolling a zero &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{3}{6} * \frac{4}{6}$ &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{12}{36}$ &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{1}{3}$;<br> F winning against E: &nbsp Odds of F rolling a six &nbsp $*$ &nbsp $1$ &nbsp $+$ &nbsp Odds of F rolling a two &nbsp $*$ &nbsp Odds of E rolling a one &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{2}{6} * 1$ &nbsp $+$ &nbsp $\frac{4}{6} * \frac{3}{6}$ &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{2}{6}$ &nbsp $+$ &nbsp $\frac{12}{36}$ &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{2}{3}$</li>  <br><br>
</ul>


<h3>Strategies</h3>
<p>For player A (the one to choose first) the best strategy would be to choose dice F. This is because it has the best overall odds, meaning if player B were to choose at
random, they would have the best advantage and statisitically would have better odds of winning against a random dice. In the case of dice F, it has a greater chance of 
having the high score when played against dice E or D. The probability that dice F wins against a randomly chosen dice is $\frac{1}{3}$ &nbsp $*$ &nbsp ($\frac{2}{3}$ &nbsp $+$ &nbsp $\frac{1}{3}$ &nbsp $+$ &nbsp $\frac{5}{9}$) &nbsp $=$ &nbsp $\frac{14}{27}$ or approximately <em>0.52</em>; so overall, choosing this dice, the odds are in your favour. 
Dice E and C overall have odds of $\frac{1}{2}$ and E has the lowest odds of $\frac{13}{27}$, and so is the worst choice overall if picking first.
</p>

<p>As the second player, the best option depends on which dice the first player chooses, and can be illustrated as shown below:</p>

<br>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
  <img src="instrasition.svg" width="400px">
</div>
<br>

<p>Dice E has a better odd at winning 
against D or simply put usually <em>'beats'</em> D,D <em>'beats'</em> C, C <em>'beats'</em> F and F <em>'beats'</em> E. Unlike all the other previous sets,
where the winning odds are $\frac{2}{3}$,
the odds of winning playing against dice D with dice F is only $\frac{5}{9}$ or approximately <em>55.6%</em>; although still likely to win,
it is not as likely when playing dice E against dice D, so an informed player should choose E in this scenario. </p>


<p> It should also be noted, that although in this particular set of die dice F has the overall best odds of winning as well as the largest average roll out of the set, it only matters whether the value of a face is higher or lower and not the <strong>absolute value</strong> of a face,
i.e. if dice F had faces = [1000,1000,2,2,2,2], although it has a much higher average roll than the other die, it still has the same odds of winning against the various other die.<cite>[2]</cite>.
